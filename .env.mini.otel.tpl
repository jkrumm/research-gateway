# Optional overlay: OpenTelemetry export from the mini instance to the VPS's
# public OTLP ingest (Traefik -> ClickStack :4318, bearertokenauth). Layered
# by scripts/launch.sh ONLY when the key resolves from the mini's secrets
# cache; otherwise the instance runs with the exporter disabled (a true
# no-op — src/env.ts's OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT is optional with no
# default). secrets-run resolves only whole-value op:// refs, hence the
# dedicated var.
